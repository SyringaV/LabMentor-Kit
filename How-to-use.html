    <h1>How to Use the cell counting feature? </h1>
    <ol style="padding-top: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Upload Hemocytometer Image:</strong> Click the "Upload Image" button to select and upload an image of the hemocytometer. Use the zoom and pan controls to adjust the image for better visibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Count Cells:</strong> Click on the numbers corresponding to the squares where you've counted cells. You can choose to count cells in either 4 or 5 squares for accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Fill Up the Table:</strong> Once you've selected the squares, a table will appear. Fill in the numbers of viable and non-viable cells you observe under the microscope for each selected square.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide Sample Information:</strong> Enter the volume of the original cell sample and the volume of the diluting liquid used. This information is necessary for calculating the dilution factor.</li>
      <li><strong>View Calculations:</strong> After entering the sample information, the calculation will automatically show the results, including the total cell count, concentration, and any other relevant metrics.</li>
      <li><strong>Review and Interpret Results:</strong> Take a moment to review the calculated results. These values can provide valuable insights into cell density and viability, which are crucial for various research and diagnostic applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Repeat as Needed:</strong> You can repeat the process as necessary for different cell samples or experiments. Ensure accuracy by carefully following the counting and data entry steps outlined above.</li>
      <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If you encounter any issues or discrepancies during the counting process, refer to troubleshooting tips or reach out to support for assistance.</li>
